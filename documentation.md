# Markdown file containing ontology description ->
1. After I cloned ontology and data '.ttl' files onto my local machine, I modified the ontology file to include the facts given in the homework.
2. Then, I imported that ontology file into data file and then, added my family members including all types of persons present in the ontology file. Also, I added residential location of every person and added employers for my siblings and myself.
3. Then, I started 'Pellet' reasoner in both ontology and data files to check those files and they both are showing correct inferences related to the provided facts and data.
